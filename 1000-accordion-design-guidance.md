# Accordion Design Guidance

An [accordion](https://clarity.design/documentation/accordion) is a user interface component that consists of vertically stacked sections, each containing multiple content panels. It allows users to expand and collapse these sections, enabling them to manage large amounts of information efficiently while maintaining a clear overview of the available content.

## Guidance

- Design teams **must** use accordions to display large amounts of information without overwhelming users, allowing them to expand and collapse sections as needed.
- Design teams **must not** use an accordion when all content is important to the user, as it might cause confusion or hinder access to essential information.
- Design teams **must not** use an accordion when there is very little visible content on the page, as it can lead to unnecessary complexity and reduce usability.
- Design teams **must not** include overly lengthy information in the accordion content, as this can overwhelm users and diminish the effectiveness of the accordion's collapsible design.
- Design teams **must** ensure that the accordion header is concise and clearly conveys the nature of the content within, allowing users to quickly understand what information is contained in each section.
- Design teams **should** use accordions to present secondary information or to give an overview of a page's content, helping users easily navigate and access relevant details without overwhelming them.

## Accessibility

- Design teams **must not** include clickable elements in the accordion header, as this can lead to confusion about the intended functionality and disrupt the user's interaction with the accordion.
- Design teams **should** include only a title and brief information (if needed) in the accordion header to maintain clarity and focus, ensuring users can quickly understand the content within each section.
- Design teams **must not** nest accordions more than two levels deep to prevent overwhelming users with excessive content hierarchy, which can lead to confusion and difficulty navigating the information.
