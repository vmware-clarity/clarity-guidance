# Accordion Design Guidance

An [accordion](https://clarity.design/documentation/accordion) is a collection of vertically stacked sections with multiple content panels.

## Guidance

- **Must** use accordions when you need to display a lot of different information and the user doesnâ€™t need it all at once.
- **Must not** use an accordion if all the content is important to a user.
- **Must not** use an accordion if there is very little visible content on the page.
- **Must not** add too long information in the accordion content.
- The accordion header **must** be coincise and convey the nature of the content.
- **Should** use accordions to present secondary information or to provide an overview of a page's content.

## Accessibility 

- The accordion header **must not** contain clickable elements.
- The accordion header **should** include only a title and brief info (if needed).
- Accordions **must not** be nested more than 2 levels.
