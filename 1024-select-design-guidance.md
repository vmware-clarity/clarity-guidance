# Select Design Guidance

A [select](https://clarity.design/documentation/select) control enables users to choose one or multiple items from a list of options, providing a streamlined way to make selections within forms or applications.

## Guidance

- Select controls **must** be used when users don't need to see the list of options until they click to view it.
- Select controls **must** have default option pre-selected or includes a placeholder. The select field **should** not be left empty, as this provides guidance, reduces confusion, and improves usability by prompting users to make a selection.
- Multiple lines of text in select field options **should** be avoided. If the text is too long for one line, it **should** be truncated with an ellipsis (â€¦) to maintain clarity and improve readability.
- Labels **should** be used to clearly describe the data represented in the select field, ensuring users understand the context and purpose of their selections.
- Appropriate [select states](https://clarity.design/documentation/select#states) **should** be used to provide clear feedback on user interactions. This helps users understand the current status of their selection, improving usability and ensuring that they can navigate the form effectively.
- A select control **should not** be used if there are fewer than six options. Instead, the [radio](https://clarity.design/documentation/radio) component **should** be used to provide a clearer and more accessible choice for users.
