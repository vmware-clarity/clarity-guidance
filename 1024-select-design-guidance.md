# Select Design Guidance

A [select](https://clarity.design/documentation/select) control enables users to choose one or multiple items from a list of options, providing a streamlined way to make selections within forms or applications.

## Guidance

- Design teams **must** use a select control when users don't need to see the list of options until they click to view it.
- Design teams **must** ensure that a select control has a default option pre-selected or includes a placeholder. The select field should not be left empty, as this provides guidance, reduces confusion, and improves usability by prompting users to make a selection.
- Design teams **should** avoid using multiple lines of text in select field options. If the text is too long for one line, it should be truncated with an ellipsis (â€¦) to maintain clarity and improve readability.
- Design teams **should** use labels to clearly describe the data represented in the select field, ensuring users understand the context and purpose of their selections.
- Design teams **should** use appropriate [select states](https://clarity.design/documentation/select#states) to provide clear feedback on user interactions. This helps users understand the current status of their selection, improving usability and ensuring that they can navigate the form effectively.
- Design teams **should not** use a select control if there are fewer than six options. Instead, they should consider using a [radio](https://clarity.design/documentation/radio) component to provide a clearer and more accessible choice for users.
