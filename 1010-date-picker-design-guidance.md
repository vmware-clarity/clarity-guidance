# Date Picker Design Guidance

The [date picker](https://clarity.design/documentation/datepicker) component enables users to select and input a date either by manually typing it into the input field or by utilizing a calendar popover, providing flexibility in date entry.

## Guidance

- Design teams **must not** use the date picker for entering a date of birth; they should use an input component instead.
- Design teams **must not** use the date picker to select a date that is more than 10 years in the future or past.
- Design teams **must not** use the date picker when space is limited.
- Design teams **must** keep the size of the date picker widget consistent, regardless of the text field width.

## Changelog

- **2024-10-30**: Initial guidance
