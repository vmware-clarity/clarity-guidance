# Wizard Design Guidance

The [wizard](https://clarity.design/documentation/wizard) component guides users through a series of predefined steps. Wizards help users concentrate on the necessary input for each step, reducing the likelihood of errors.

## Guidance

- Design teams **must** have at least two steps in a wizard to provide a meaningful guided experience for users.
- Design teams **must not** include long or complex content in each step of the wizard, as this can overwhelm users and hinder their progress. Each step should be clear and concise.
- Design teams **must not** use a wizard in conjunction with an additional modal, as this can lead to lost context and block accessibility for keyboard users. Itâ€™s important to maintain a clear and intuitive interface.
- Design teams **must not** use a wizard when users need to leave mid-workflow and resume later, as this can disrupt their progress and lead to confusion. Instead, consider using a different structure that allows for saving progress.
- Design teams **should** use a wizard when the content is self-sufficient and does not require access to other parts of the app, as wizards can block access to necessary areas for completing the process.
- Design teams **may** use a wizard to guide users through a defined step-by-step process, helping to ensure clarity and improve user understanding.

## Content Guidelines

- Design teams **must** ensure the wizard title describes the overall workflow to provide users with clear context about the steps they are about to take.
- Design teams **must** ensure the content title is similar to its step title to maintain consistency and help users easily follow along with the workflow.
- Design teams **must** ensure the content is concise and provides a clear explanation of the task or information that the user should focus on to avoid confusion and improve usability.
