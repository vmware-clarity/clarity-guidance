# Password Component

A [password](https://clarity.design/documentation/password) component is a specialized input field with the ability to toggle between a masked field or to view the password in plain text.

## Guidance

- **Must** use a password field when the user needs to set or input the password.
- **Must not** use an asterisk (`*`) in the password field.
- **Should** show password requirements in the helper text to guide the user.
- **Should not** hide the helper requirements in a signpost or reveal them only after the user fails the first attempt.
- **May** use a password field when the user needs to mask the input content.

## Changelog

- **2024-10-22**: Initial guidance
