# Password Design Guidance

A [password](https://clarity.design/documentation/password) component is an input field that allows users to toggle between hiding or showing the password in plain text.

## Guidance

- Design teams **must** use a password field when the user needs to set or input a password. This ensures security and consistency across the interface.
- Design teams **must not** use an asterisk (\*) in the password field. Instead, use dots or bullets to mask the password for consistency and clarity.
- Design teams **should** show password requirements in the helper text to guide the user, helping them create valid passwords without confusion.
- Design teams **should** not hide password requirements in a signpost or reveal them only after the user fails the first attempt. Providing them upfront helps prevent frustration and improves the user experience.
- Design teams **may** use a password field when the user needs to mask the input content to protect sensitive information, even if it is not a password.
