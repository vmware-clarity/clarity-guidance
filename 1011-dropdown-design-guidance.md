# Dropdown Design Guidance

The [dropdown](https://clarity.design/documentation/dropdown) component allows users to select an option or action from a contextual list. The dropdown is typically triggered by a button.

## Guidance

- Dropdowns **must** be used to facilitate immediate actions or navigate users outside the current context, ensuring seamless transition and clear user flow.
- Dropdown menus **must not** be used to hide primary actions. Primary actions **should** be readily accessible and not be concealed behind a dropdown.
- Dropdown menus **must not** be used to hide primary actions, as these actions **should** be readily accessible and not concealed behind a dropdown.
- Dropdowns **should** utilize nested categories for longer lists. Nested dropdowns improve usability, readability, and discoverability
- Design teams **must not** use a dropdown menu as a form control for user input. Instead, they **should** use a [select](https://clarity.design/documentation/select) component, which is better suited for handling form data and allows for clearer interaction and selection.
- Nested dropdown menus **should** be limited to three levels. Limiting levels prevents confusion, and maintains clarity.
  
## Content Guidelines

- Descriptions of dropdown options **must** be kept as short as possible to enhance readability and ensure users can quickly understand their choices.
- Labels **should** be worded to clearly indicate the dropdown action, helping users understand what to expect when interacting with the dropdown.
