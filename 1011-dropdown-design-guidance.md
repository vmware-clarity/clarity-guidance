# Dropdown Design Guidance

The [dropdown](https://clarity.design/documentation/dropdown) component allows users to select an option or action from a contextual list. The dropdown is typically triggered by a button.

## Guidance

- Design teams **must** use a dropdown to facilitate immediate actions or navigate users outside of the current context, ensuring a seamless transition and clear user flow.
- Design teams **must not** use a dropdown menu to hide primary actions, as these actions should be readily accessible and not concealed behind a dropdown.
- Design teams **must not** use a dropdown menu to hide primary actions, as these actions should be readily accessible and not concealed behind a dropdown. 
- Design teams **should** use nested dropdowns to organize longer lists into categories, allowing users to click to reveal deeper levels and enhancing navigation efficiency.
- Design teams **must not** use a dropdown menu as a form control for user input. Instead, they should use a [select](https://clarity.design/documentation/select) component, which is better suited for handling form data and allows for clearer interaction and selection.
- Design teams **should** limit nested dropdown menus to three levels to prevent confusion and maintain clarity, ensuring users can easily navigate without feeling overwhelmed.

## Content Guidelines

- Design teams **must** keep the descriptions of dropdown options as short as possible to enhance readability and ensure users can quickly understand their choices.
- Design teams **should** phrase the label to clearly indicate the dropdown action, helping users understand what to expect when interacting with the dropdown.
