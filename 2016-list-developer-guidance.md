# List Developer Guidance

A [list](https://clarity.design/documentation/list) displays vertical groups of items and can be nested to represent hierarchical relationships, allowing for organized presentation of information.

## Guidance

There are three types of lists: unordered, ordered, and unstyled. Each type serves a different purpose in organizing and presenting information.

- List groups **must** be used to group related items and organize them vertically for clarity and easy navigation.
- Lists **must** use unordered format when item order doesn't matter, ensuring clarity, visual organization, and accessibility for assistive technologies.
- Ordered lists **must** be used to convey priority, hierarchy, or sequence among items, helping users understand item relationships and importance. This clarifies item relationships, hierarchy, and sequence for users.
- Unstyled lists **must be** used when styling is unnecessary. This allows for a clean presentation of information, reducing visual distractions, and improving comprehension and clarity
- **Must** use the `.list` class in all types of list elements.
- Lists **may** be nested, allowing different types of lists to be mixed within nested groupings. This enables a more complex hierarchy and organization of information, helping users to better understand relationships between items.
