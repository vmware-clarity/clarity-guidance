# Vertical Nav Design Guidance

The [vertical nav](https://clarity.design/documentation/vertical-nav) component offers vertically-aligned navigation links. It accommodates as many links as needed, allowing users to scroll when the content exceeds the viewport.

## Guidance

- Design teams **must** use the vertical nav to collapse and expand the navigation, allowing users to maximize content space and maintain focus on the task at hand.
- Design teams **must** use dividers and groups to separate logical clusters of navigation items, enhancing clarity and helping users quickly locate related links.
- Design teams **must not** use vertical navigation with a header and a sub-navigation menu, as this creates too many navigation points and can confuse users. Keeping navigation straightforward improves usability and clarity.

### Icons

- Design teams **must** maintain consistency in applying icons to top-level navigation items. Avoid using icons for some top navigation items while leaving others without, as this can create confusion and disrupt the user's navigation experience.
- Design teams **must** apply icons consistently to top-level navigation items to enhance visual recognition and understanding.  Design teams **must not** apply icons to child links, as this can clutter the interface and create unnecessary complexity for users.
- Design teams **must** place icons to the left of the top navigation labels to ensure a consistent layout and improve the overall usability of the navigation.
- Design teams **should** use icons to describe navigation items, as they provide helpful context when the navigation is collapsed, enhancing user understanding and navigation efficiency.
- Design teams **must** use semi-bold font weight for top-level navigation items, as this aligns with Clarity's design principles by creating a clear visual hierarchy and improving readability.
- Design teams must use a caret on the right-hand side to expand and collapse navigation groups, providing users with clear visual indicators of available actions.
- Design teams **must** use normal font weight for child links to ensure they are visually distinct from top-level navigation items and maintain a clear hierarchy. This approach aligns with Clarity's design principles by enhancing readability and usability.

## Content Guidelines

- Design teams **must** use short and concise labels for navigation items to prevent the need for an ellipsis. Lengthy labels are trimmed and followed by an ellipsis, which can reduce clarity and usability.
