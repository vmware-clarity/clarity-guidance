# Vertical Nav Design Guidance

The [vertical nav](https://clarity.design/documentation/vertical-nav) component provides vertically-aligned navigation links. It can fit as many navigation links as needed by scrolling when the content exceeds the viewport.


## Guidance

- **Must** use to collapse and expand the navigation to free up space for the content area.
- **Must** use dividers and groups to separate logical clusters of navigation items.
- **Must not** use vertical navigation with a header and a sub navigation menu. Having too many places for navigation will be confusing for users.

## Nav Icons

- **Must** maintain consistency across using icons on navigation items. Avoid using icons to some of top navigation items and not to others.
- **Must** apply icons to top-level navigation items. *Must not** apply icons to child links.  
- **Must** place icons to the left of the top navigation labels.
- **Should** use icons to describe navigation items which are helpful when the navigation is collapsed.
- **Must** use semi-bold font weight for top-level navigation items.
- **Must** use a caret on the right-hand side to expand and collapse navigation groups.
- **Must** use normal font weight for child links.

## Content Guidelines

- **Must** use short and concise label for navigation items in order to prevent an ellipsis from being required. Lengthy labels are trimmed and followed by an ellipsis.

## Changelog

- **2024-10-21**: Initial guidance
