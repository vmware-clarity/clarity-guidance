# Vertical Nav Component

[Vertical Nav](https://clarity.design/documentation/vertical-nav) is a vertically aligned navigational component. It can fit as many navigation links as needed, scrolling when the content exceeds the viewport.


## Guidance

- **Must** use to collapse and expand the navigation to free up space for the content area.
- **Must** use dividers and headers to separate logical clusters of navigation items.
- **Must** NOT use vertical navigation with a header and a sub navigation menu. Having too many places for navigation will be confusing for users.

## Nav Icons
- **Must** maintain consistency across using icons on navigation items. Avoid using icons to some of top navigation items and not to others.
- **Must** apply icons only to top-level navigation items. Do not add them to child links.
- **Should** place icons to the left of the top navigation labels.
- **Should** use icons to describe navigation items which are helpful when the navigation is collapsed.

## Nav Hierarchy
- **Must** use semi bold font weight for Top-level navigation items and have a caret to the right.
- **Must** use normal font weight for child links.
- **Must** use semi bold font weight Top-level navigation items without child item.

## Content Guidelines
- **Must** use short and consise label for navigation items inorder to prevent an ellipsis from showing up. Lengthy lables are trimmed and followed by an ellipsis.
