# Checkbox Design Guidance

The [checkbox](https://clarity.design/documentation/checkbox) control enables users to select one or more options from a list of multiple choices, providing a straightforward way to capture user preferences.

## Guidance

- Checkboxes **must** be used to enable users to select one or more options from a list of choices.
- Checkboxes **must** not be used for mutually exclusive options. Instead, [radio buttons](https://clarity.design/documentation/radio) **should** be used for such cases.
- Checkboxes **should not** be used for binary choices outside of forms. Instead, [toggle switches](https://clarity.design/documentation/toggle-switch) **should** be used.
- Checkbox labels **should** be limited to a single line, enhancing readability and ensuring clarity for users.
- Checkboxes **should** utilize clear [checkbox states](https://clarity.design/documentation/checkbox#states) (e.g., checked, unchecked, disabled, focused) to provide concise feedback on user interactions and enhance usability.

## Changelog
