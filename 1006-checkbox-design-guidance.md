# Checkbox Design Guidance

The [checkbox](https://clarity.design/documentation/checkbox) control enables users to select one or more options from a list of multiple choices, providing a straightforward way to capture user preferences.

## Guidance

- Design teams **must** use checkboxes to allow users to select one or more options from a list of choices.
- Design teams **must not** use checkboxes for mutually exclusive options; instead, they should use a [radio](https://clarity.design/documentation/radio) button for such cases.
- Design teams **should not** use checkboxes for binary choices outside of a form; instead, they should use a [toggle switch](https://clarity.design/documentation/toggle-switch).
- Design teams **should** keep the label of the checkbox to a single line to enhance readability and ensure clarity for users.
- Design teams **should** use appropriate [checkbox states](https://clarity.design/documentation/checkbox#states) to provide clear feedback on user interactions and improve overall usability.

## Changelog
