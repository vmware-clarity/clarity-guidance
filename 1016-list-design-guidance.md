# List Component

[List](https://clarity.design/documentation/list) show vertical groups of items and can be nested to show hierarchy.

## Guidance

There are three types of lists: `unordered`, `ordered`, and `unstyled`.

### List Usage

- **Must** use a list to group related items and organize them vertically.
- **Must** use an `unordered` list when the order does not matter.
- **Must** use an `ordered` list when you need to convey a priority, hierarchy, or sequence between list items.
- **Must** use an `unstyled` list when styling is unnecessary to improve comprehension or hierarchy.
- Lists can be nested, different types of lists can be mixed within nested groupings.

## Changelog

- **2024-10-21**: Initial guidance
