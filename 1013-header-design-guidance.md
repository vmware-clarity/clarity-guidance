# Header Design Guidance

The page [header](https://clarity.design/documentation/header) component defines the top of a page. Provides a consistent place for branding, navigation, search, and access to global application actions like settings and notifications.

## Guidance

- Design teams **must** use one header per page, and it must be positioned at the start of the page to provide a consistent layout and enhance user navigation.
- Design teams **must not** use a header at the top of smaller containers, such as popups or dialogs, to avoid confusion and maintain a clear distinction between page-level and contextual navigation.
- Design teams **must not** overload the header with too many items; a maximum of four items should be used in the top-level navigation to ensure clarity and ease of use for users.
- Design teams **should** incorporate the [search](https://clarity.design/documentation/header#search) feature, taking into account its importance and usefulness within the application to improve user efficiency and navigation.
- Design teams **should** use right-side action area of header for global actions and top-level navigational items that are important, yet visited less frequently.

## Content Guidelines

- Design teams **must not** use headings that do not clearly convey their meaning or purpose. Instead, they should ensure that all headings are short and concise, providing users with clear context for navigation.
- Design teams **should** pair icons with text when the text adds relevant context for the user, such as the user's name, to enhance clarity and understanding.
