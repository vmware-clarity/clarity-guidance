# Header Component

A page [Header](https://clarity.design/documentation/header) component defines the top of a page. Provides a consistent place for branding, navigation, search, and access to global application actions like settings and notifications.

## Guidance

- **Must** use one header per page and **must** be at the start of the page.
- **Must not** use at the top of a smaller container like a popup or dialog.
- **Must not** overload with too many items. Use maximum of four items in top-level navigation.
- **Should** use [search](https://clarity.design/documentation/header#search) feature based on search's prominence and its utility within the application.
- **Should** use right-side action area of header for global actions and top-level navigational items that are important, yet visited less frequently.

## Content Guidelines

- **Must not** use vague headings. Use short and concise heading for navigation items.
- **Should** pair icons with text when the provided text gives additional context specific to the user. For example, the user's name.
