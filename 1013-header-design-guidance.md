# Header Design Guidance

The page [header](https://clarity.design/documentation/header) component defines the top of a page. Provides a consistent place for branding, navigation, search, and access to global application actions like settings and notifications.

## Guidance

- Each page **must** have only one header, placed at the top. This improves navigation, and readability.
- Headers **must not** be used in smaller containers like popups or dialogs. This avoids confusion and clarifies page-level vs. contextual navigation.
- Headers **must not** be overloaded with excessive items. Top-level navigation **should** be limited to four items. This ensures clarity and ease of use for users.
- Considering its application importance, the [search](https://clarity.design/documentation/header#search) feature **should** be incorporated into the header to enhance user efficiency and navigation.
- Headers **should** use the right-side action area for global actions and top-level navigation items that are important but less frequently visited. This optimizes header space, prioritizes key actions, and streamlines navigation.

## Content Guidelines

- Design teams **must not** use headings that do not clearly convey their meaning or purpose. Instead, they **should** ensure that all headings are short and concise, providing users with clear context for navigation.
- Design teams **should** pair icons with text when the text adds relevant context for the user, such as the user's name, to enhance clarity and understanding.
