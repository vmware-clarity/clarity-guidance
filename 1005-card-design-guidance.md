# Card Design Guidance

[Cards](https://clarity.design/documentation/card) are containers that group related content and actions together, providing a cohesive way to present information in a visually appealing format.```

## Guidance

### Usage

- Applications **must** use separate cards for distinct topics, differentiating content and actions, improving organization, and enhancing user comprehension.
- Cards **must** be used to present high-level information and guide users toward related actions and details. This facilitates quick understanding and encourages user engagement with the content.
- Clickable cards **must** be used when a card is intended to initiate an action. This clearly indicates to users that the card is interactive and provides a pathway to further engagement.
- Cards **may** contain various content types, including text, images, dropdown menus, media blocks, lists, and list groups, enabling rich information presentation and actions within a cohesive space.

### Anatomy

- Buttons **must** be left-aligned in the card footer. This alignment maintains a consistent visual structure and enhances usability by making actions easy to find and access.
- Dividers **should** be used in cards to separate different regions. This helps organize content visually, improving readability and allowing users to quickly identify distinct sections within the card.
- Flat buttons **should** be used on cards to maintain their prominence relative to other information. This design choice helps ensure that the buttons are easily identifiable without overwhelming the card's content.
- The card footer **may** include a primary action and a single additional (secondary) action, both left-aligned. This layout helps to prioritize the main action while still offering users an alternative option if needed.
- The card footer **may** use a dropdown menu for more than two actions. This approach keeps the interface clean and organized, allowing users to access multiple actions without cluttering the card.

### Placement

- Cards **must** be grouped by theme or element. This organization helps users understand the relationships between different pieces of information and actions, enhancing the overall user experience.
- Cards **must not** be nested within another card. This practice can lead to confusion and clutter, making it difficult for users to navigate and understand the content hierarchy.
- Grids **should** be used to place cards in fixed rows and columns. This layout facilitates easy scanning of content, improving organization and enhancing user navigation through the information.
- Cards **should not** be overloaded with excessive content, too many actions, or links within the content. Keeping cards concise ensures clarity and enhances usability.

### Style

- Titles **should** be used in 20px Metropolis Medium and content **should** be used in 14px Metropolis Regular. This maintains a clear visual hierarchy and improves readability, helping users navigate the card content more effectively.
