# Card Component

[Cards](https://clarity.design/documentation/card) are containers around a related grouping of content and actions.

## Guidance

### Card Usage

- **Must** use seperate cards for distinct topics.
- **Must** use a card to present high-level information and guide the user toward related actions and details.
- **Must** use clickable cards, if you want to use a card to initiate an action.
- Content like Text, Images, Dropdown menus, Media blocks, Lists and List groups can be used inside Cards.

### Card Anatomy

- **Must** left-align 'Action button(s)' in the card footer.
- **Should** use dividers in cards to separate regions in the card.
- **Should** use 'Flat buttons' on cards to keep their prominence in perspective with other information on the card.
- **May** use a primary action and a single additional (secondary) action (if required) in the card footer,left-aligned.
- **May** use a dropdown menu for more than two actions in the card footer.

### Card Placement

- **Must** group cards by theme or element.
- **Must** NOT nest a card within another card.
- **Should** use a grid to place cards in fixed rows and columns, which makes it easy to quickly scan content in this layout.
- **Should** avoid using too much content, overloading the card with too many actions, or placing links within the content.

### Card Style

- **Should** have a title using 20px Metropolis Medium and content using 14px Metropolis Regular.
