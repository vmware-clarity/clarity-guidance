# Datalist Design Guidance

The [datalist](https://clarity.design/documentation/datalist) is a type of list that shows options based on selected filters, making it easier for users to find and select from a range of choices.

## Guidance

- Datalists **must** be used when users need to choose from a long list of items that require filtering before selection. This helps users quickly find the options they need without feeling overwhelmed.
- Datalists **must** be used when there is a pre-defined list of options, but the user also needs the ability to input a custom value. This provides users with guidance while still allowing flexibility in their selections.
- Datalists **should** be used when there are more than 13 options available. This helps keep the interface clean and manageable, allowing users to easily filter and select their desired option.
- Datalists **must** use error and success states to provide real-time feedback immediately after a user's input. This feedback helps users understand if their input is valid and enhances the overall user experience.

## Changelog
