# Datalist Design Guidance

The [datalist](https://clarity.design/documentation/datalist) is a type of list that becomes contextualized through the selection of extensive pre-defined filters.

## Guidance

- **Must** use a datalist when the user needs to choose from a long list of items to be filtered before selection.
- **Must** use a datalist when you have a pre-defined list of options, but the user needs to input a custom value.
- **Should** use a datalist when there are more than 13 options.
- Use `error` and `success` states for a datalist to provide real-time feedback immediately after a user's input.

## Changelog

- **2024-10-22**: Initial guidance
