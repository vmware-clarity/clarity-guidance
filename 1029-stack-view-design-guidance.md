# Stack View Design Guidance

The [stack view](https://clarity.design/documentation/stack-view) component displays key/value pairs that users can expand to reveal more details, providing a clear and organized way to present information.

## Guidance

### Usage

- Design teams **must** use the stack view to progressively display a large set of data (key/value pairs) or to allow users to reveal more complex or less frequently used data as needed, enhancing clarity and usability.
- Design teams **may** use the stack view to display related key/value pairs, helping users understand connections between the data while maintaining an organized layout.

### Labels

- Design teams **must** provide concise labels (keys) that clearly indicate what information is associated with each label, enhancing user understanding and navigation.
- Design teams **must not** use icons as labels in the stack view, as this can lead to confusion and reduce clarity in understanding the associated data.

### Value Editing

- Design teams **must** place an edit button above the editable stack view, positioned to the right, to provide users with easy access to editing options.
- Design teams **must** ensure that clicking the edit button on an editable stack view opens a modal, allowing users to make changes without losing context.
