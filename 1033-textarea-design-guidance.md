# Textarea Design Guidance

The [textarea](https://clarity.design/documentation/textarea) component enables the user to input multiple lines of text.

## Guidance

- Design teams **must** use a textarea when the expected user input spans multiple lines. If only a single line is needed, use an [input](https://clarity.design/documentation/input) instead. This ensures the field aligns with user expectations and encourages appropriate input behavior.
- Design teams **must not** use a textarea as a substitute for a proper label element. Labels are essential for accessibility and ensure users clearly understand the purpose of the field. A textarea **may** be used to show an example of the expected input but **should** not replace helper text intended to guide the user.
- Design teams **should** provide a clear and concise visible label for context, ensuring users understand what input is expected and reducing the chance of errors.
