# Textarea Design Guidance

[Textarea](https://clarity.design/documentation/textarea) component enable the user to input a single sentence or less of text.

## Guidance

- **Must** use Textarea when the expected user input may be more than a single line. If only a single line is expected, use [Input](https://clarity.design/documentation/input) instead.
- **Should** provide a clear and concise label for context.
- Placeholders **should not** be a substitute for a proper label element. It may only be used to show an example of the type of data that should be entered into a form. It **should not** be used in place of helper text either.
- [States supported for Textarea](https://clarity.design/documentation/textarea#states).
- Textarea is available in vertical, horizontal and compact layouts. [Layouts supported for Textarea](https://clarity.design/documentation/textarea#layouts)
