# Textarea Design Guidance

The [textarea](https://clarity.design/documentation/textarea) component enables the user to input multiple lines of text.

## Guidance

- **Must** use a textarea when the expected user input may be more than a single line. If only a single line is expected, use an [input](https://clarity.design/documentation/input) instead.
- **Should** provide a clear and concise visible label for context.
- **Should not** be a substitute for a proper label element. It **may** be used to show an example of the type of data that should be entered into a form, but it **should not** be used in place of helper text.


## Changelog

- **2024-10-22**: Initial guidance
