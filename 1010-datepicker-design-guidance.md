# Datepicker Component

[Datepicker](https://clarity.design/documentation/datepicker) component allows users to choose and input a date by manually typing the date into the input field or by using a calendar popover.

## Guidance

- **Must not** use for entering date of birth. Use input component instead.
- **Must not** use to choose a date that is over 10 years in the future or the past.
- **Must not** use date picker when space is limited.
- **Must** keep the size of the datepicker widget the same, regardless of text field width.

## Changelog

- **2024-10-22**: Initial guidance
