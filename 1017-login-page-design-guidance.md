# Login Page Component

The [Login Page](https://clarity.design/documentation/login) is a predefined form for applications that require authentication.

## Guidance

- **Must** use Login Page component for authentication flows to maintain consistency across the applications.
- **Must** NOT use an asterick (`*`) in the input fields of a Login Page.
- The username/password validation message **must** NOT call out whether the error occurred in the user name or password field.

## Changelog

- **2024-10-21**: Initial guidance
