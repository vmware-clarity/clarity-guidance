# Login Page Component

The [login page](https://clarity.design/documentation/login) is a predefined form for applications that require authentication.

## Guidance

- **Must** use login page component for authentication flows to maintain consistency across the applications.
- **Must not** use an asterisk (`*`) in the input fields of a login page.
- The username/password validation message **must not** call out whether the error occurred in the username or password field.

## Changelog

- **2024-10-22**: Initial guidance
