# Numbering

The CIP system provides a mechanism to index and have a single source of truth for Clarity Improvement Proposals, as
well as iterate on them collaboratively and transparently. This document describes the guidance numbering system which
is based on [Google's API Numbering](https://google.aip.dev/2).

## Assigning CIP Numbers

The Clarity team is responsible for assigning a number to each CIP when it is accepted as a draft for review.
Importantly, *all* CIPs have numbers, not just approved ones. The [CIP Index](/) clearly clearly delineates which CIPs
are approved and binding and which are under discussion.

The team may decide to reserve a specific of numbers for grouping CIPs. Beyond this, numbers are assigned arbitrarily.
In general, the team will simply use the next available number.

## CIP Blocks

Currently recognized blocks of guidance numbers are:

- **1-99**: Reserved for Meta-Guidance (generally process-related)
- **100-199**: General Design System Guidance and Patterns (fonts, icons, spacing)
- **1000-1999**: Designer Guidance
- **2000-2999**: Developer Guidance
- **3000-4999**: Design Patterns
- **5000-5999**: Guidance for other libraries/components/patterns used in VCF to align with Clarity (e.g. VMW-NGX)
