# File Picker Design Guidance

The [file picker](https://clarity.design/documentation/file-picker) component allows users to select one or more files to upload.

## Guidance


- **Should** use `Compact` layout in places with limited vertical space, and information density is needed; otherwise the `Vertical` or `Horizontal` layouts are recommended.
- Use appropriate [file picker states](https://clarity.design/documentation/file-picker#states).
- **Should** use helper text to tell users which format the file input will accept, i.e., PNG, JPG, PDF, etc.
- **Should** follow the [forms pattern guidelines](https://clarity.design/documentation/forms).

## Changelog

- **2024-10-21**: Initial guidance
