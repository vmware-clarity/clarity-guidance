# File Picker Design Guidance

The [file picker](https://clarity.design/documentation/file-picker) component enables users to select one or more files for upload, providing a straightforward interface for managing file selection.

## Guidance

- Compact layouts **should** be used in areas with limited vertical space where higher information density is needed; otherwise, vertical or horizontal layouts are recommended for better clarity and usability.
- [File picker states](https://clarity.design/documentation/file-picker#states) **should** display appropriate states (following Clarity Design guidelines) to facilitate clear user feedback and intuitive file selection/upload experiences.
- File upload inputs **should** include helper text specifying accepted file formats (e.g., PNG, JPG, PDF) to inform users of compatible options before uploading.
- File picker components **should** adhere to Clarity Design's [forms pattern guidelines](https://clarity.design/documentation/forms) to ensure consistency and clarity within the application.

## Changelog

- **2024-10-30**: Initial guidance
