# Combobox Design Guidance

The [combobox](https://clarity.design/documentation/combobox) is a versatile component that combines a text input box with a drop-down list. Users can type text into the input field to filter and narrow down the predefined options available in the drop-down menu.

## Guidance

### Combobox Usage

- Design teams **must** use a combobox for lists with more than 10 options. This allows users to easily filter through the options by typing, improving usability and efficiency.
- Design teams **must** use a combobox when search and filtering capabilities are needed. This allows users to quickly find specific options from a long list, improving accuracy in their selections and reducing the time spent searching.
- Design teams **must not** allow free text input that is not part of the predefined list in a combobox. This ensures that users only select valid options, maintaining consistency and preventing errors in data entry.
- Design teams **should** use a combobox when selecting multiple items from a list. This allows users to easily filter and choose options while keeping the interface organized and user-friendly.
- Design teams **should** use a combobox when data needs to be loaded asynchronously. This allows users to begin their selection while the options are being fetched, enhancing the overall user experience and reducing wait times.
- Design teams **should** use a combobox when custom input is required or when thereâ€™s a need to display a richer user interface in the list. This enhances user interaction by allowing for both predefined options and unique entries, improving flexibility and functionality.

### Combobox Typography

- Design teams **must** keep the option text in the combobox short and concise to improve readability. This helps users quickly scan and understand their choices, enhancing the overall user experience.
- Design teams **should** include a label for the combobox to ensure accessibility. This helps users understand the purpose of the input and supports those using assistive technologies.
- Design teams **should not** allow the length of the items in a combobox to exceed the width of the text field. This ensures that all options are visible and prevents layout issues, maintaining a clean and user-friendly interface.
