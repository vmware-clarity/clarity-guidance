# Spinner Design Guidance

A [spinner](https://clarity.design/documentation/spinner) component is a visual indicator of an ongoing, user-initiated process.

## Guidance

- **Must** use page spinners for tracking the progress of an operation related to an entire page.
- **Must** use inline spinners for tracking the progress of an operation related to a specific component.
- **Must** place the spinner where you want to focus the user’s attention when the process completes.
- **Should** provide a brief description of the process, for example, “loading …”.
- **May** use progress bar as an alternative to spinner, if more space is availble. 

## Changelog

- **2024-10-22**: Initial guidance
