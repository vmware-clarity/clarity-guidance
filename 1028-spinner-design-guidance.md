# Spinner Design Guidance

A [spinner](https://clarity.design/documentation/spinner) component visually indicates an ongoing, user-initiated process, signaling to users that the system is working and they should wait.

## Guidance

- Design teams **must** use page spinners to track the progress of operations that affect the entire page, ensuring users understand that the page is temporarily unavailable.
- Design teams **must** use inline spinners to track the progress of operations related to specific components, ensuring users know which part of the interface is being processed.
- Design teams **must** place the spinner where the user’s attention should be directed once the process is complete, ensuring a smooth transition and clear feedback.
- Design teams **should** provide a brief description of the process, such as “Loading…”, to give users context about what is happening.
- Design teams **may** use progress bar as an alternative to spinner, if more space is available.

## Changelog

- **2024-10-30**: Initial guidance
