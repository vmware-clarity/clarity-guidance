# File Picker Developer Guidance

The [file picker](https://clarity.design/documentation/file-picker) component enables users to select one or more files for upload, providing a straightforward interface for managing file selection.

## Guidance

- **Should** use the appropriate [file picker states](https://clarity.design/documentation/file-picker#states) to provide clear feedback to users about their file selection and upload process, helping users make informed decisions and navigate the interaction effectively.
- **Should** use helper text to inform users about the accepted file formats for input, such as PNG, JPG, or PDF, ensuring users understand their options before uploading files.
- **Should** follow the [forms pattern guidelines](https://clarity.design/documentation/forms) to ensure consistency and clarity in the design of file picker components within the overall application.
