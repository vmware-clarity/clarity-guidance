# Clarity Improvement Proposals (CIPs)

Focused design documents for leveraging the [Clarity Design System](https://clarity.design). Clarity guidance provides high-level, concise documentation for designing and developing with the Clarity Design System. The goal is for these documents to serve as the source of truth for Clarity guidance at Broadcom.

## Welcome

CIPs are design documents that summarize Clarity's design decisions. They also provide a framework and system for us to document Clarity's rules and practices.

### Curious about the basics?

CIPs are a combination of design guidance and a system we use to manage and track that guidance.

### Want to help?

Interested in helping with CIPs? Contribute by proposing new guidance, commenting on existing CIPs, or fixing typos. All contributions are welcome!
