# Radio Button Design Guidance

A [radio button](https://clarity.design/documentation/radio) is a form element that allows users to select one option from a group, ensuring clear choice among mutually exclusive options.```

## Guidance

- Design teams **must** use radio buttons when only one item can be selected from a list.
- *Design teams **must not** leave all radio buttons unselected. They should mark the first item or the most preferred item as selected by default.
- Design teams **must** use radio buttons when the list includes at least two mutually exclusive options.
- Design teams **must not** use radio buttons when more than six options are available. They should consider using a [select](https://clarity.design/documentation/select) component instead.
- Design teams **must not** use radio buttons for functionality like “accepting terms of service” or similar. They should use a [checkbox](https://clarity.design/documentation/checkbox) instead.  
- Design teams **should** use appropriate [radio button states](https://clarity.design/documentation/radio#states) to provide clear feedback on user interactions and enhance the overall user experience.

## Changelog

- **2024-10-22**: Initial guidance
