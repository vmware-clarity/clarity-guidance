# Badge Design Guidance

[Badge](https://clarity.design/documentation/badge) component is a dynamic status modifier to other components that indicate the number of instances of that component.

## Guidance

- **Must** use badge to highlight the count, while a [label](https://clarity.design/documentation/label) can be used to display metadata, which is usually text content. A label can contain a badge.
- **Must** pair badge with a [label](https://clarity.design/documentation/label) or text that conveys the information.
- **Must** use 99+ instead of the number, if number is over 99.

## Accessibility Guidelines

- **Should** use a variety of colours for different badges. 

## Changelog

- **2024-10-21**: Initial guidance
