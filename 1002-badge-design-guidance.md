# Badge Design Guidance

The [badge](https://clarity.design/documentation/badge) component serves as a dynamic status modifier for other components, indicating the number of instances related to that component and providing users with quick, contextual information.

## Guidance

- Design teams **must** use a badge to highlight the count of items, while a [label](https://clarity.design/documentation/label) should be used for metadata, typically as text content. A label can also contain a badge for added context. This approach enhances visual clarity, separates contexts, ensures relevance, and improves accessibility for users.
- Design teams **must** pair a badge with a [label](https://clarity.design/documentation/label) or text that conveys the relevant information. This ensures users understand the context of the badge, enhancing clarity and usability.
- Design teams **must** use "99+" instead of displaying the actual number when the count exceeds 99. This keeps the interface clean and avoids overwhelming users with large numbers.

## Accessibility Guidelines

- Design teams should use a variety of colors for different badges to provide clear visual distinctions, enhancing usability and helping users quickly identify different statuses or categories.
