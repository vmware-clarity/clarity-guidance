# Badge Design Guidance

The [badge](https://clarity.design/documentation/badge) component serves as a dynamic status modifier for other components, indicating the number of instances related to that component and providing users with quick, contextual information.

## Guidance

- Badges **must** be used to display item counts. [Labels](https://clarity.design/documentation/label) **should** be used for metadata (text content), and may contain badges for added context. This approach enhances visual clarity, separates contexts, ensures relevance, and improves accessibility for users.
- Badges **must** be paired with a [label](https://clarity.design/documentation/label) or text that provides relevant context. This ensures users understand the context of the badge.
- Counts exceeding 99 **must** display "99+" to maintain interface cleanliness and prevent user overload.

## Accessibility Guidelines

- Badges **should** use distinct colors to differentiate statuses or categories, enhancing usability and facilitating quick identification.

## Changelog

- **2024-10-30**: Initial guidance
