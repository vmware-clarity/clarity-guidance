# Table Design Guidance

The [table](https://clarity.design/documentation/table) is a component that use rows and columns to display information in a grid view.

## Guidance

- Table components **must** be used wherever static data needs to be presented in a tabular format. This ensures consistency and alignment with the design system.
- For advanced features like sorting, filtering, pagination, or batch operations on structured data, the datagrid component **must** be used, ensuring alignment with user needs and the design system.
- Borderless tables **should** be used when presenting data with a clean and minimalistic appearance. This helps maintain a streamlined visual style while keeping the focus on the content.
- Compact tables **should** be used when vertical space is limited, as this variant reduces row height and ensures better use of available space.
- Vertical tables **may** be used when a header is not needed. The leftmost cells in the table can function as either data or header cells, depending on the context.
