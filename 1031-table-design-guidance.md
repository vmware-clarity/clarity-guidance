# Table Design Guidance

The [table](https://clarity.design/documentation/table) is a component that use rows and columns to display information in a grid view.

## Guidance

- Design teams **must** use the table component wherever static data needs to be presented in a tabular format. This ensures consistency and alignment with the design system.
- Design teams **must** alternatively use the [datagrid](https://clarity.design/documentation/datagrid) for advanced features such as sorting, filtering, pagination, or performing batch operations on structured data. This ensures functionality aligns with user needs and the design system.
- Design teams **should** use a borderless table when presenting data with a clean and minimalistic appearance. This helps maintain a streamlined visual style while keeping the focus on the content.
- Design teams **should** use compact tables when vertical space is limited, as this variant reduces row height and ensures better use of available space.
- Design teams **may** use vertical tables when a header is not needed. The leftmost cells in the table can function as either data or header cells, depending on the context.
